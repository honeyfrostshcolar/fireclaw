"""ProcTHOR-specific helpers used by the A7 scene-collection pipeline.

These are thin utilities around the ProcTHOR-10K dataset format as
loaded by ``prior.load_dataset('procthor-10k')``. The core
navigation adapter lives in :class:`AI2ThorAdapter` — it accepts
ProcTHOR house dicts natively — so this module focuses on the
dataset-specific bits: filtering the 10K set to multi-room houses,
tagging each observation with the room the agent is standing in,
and producing a per-house manifest entry.

Nothing here initialises an AI2-THOR controller; the functions
operate on the offline house dicts so they can be called without a
running renderer.
