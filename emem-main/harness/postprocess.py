"""Post-processing for agent answers on academic benchmarks.

This module extracts a single responsibility previously inlined in
``replay_runner.py``: cleaning raw agent output before scoring. The rules
applied here match what was used for the reported LoCoMo and
eMEM-Bench numbers.

Rules applied to the raw agent output, in order:

1. Strip leaked meta-commentary lines that ReAct agents sometimes emit
   (``Thought:``, ``Wait``, ``Hmm``, ``Let me``, ``Action``,
   ``Action Input``, ``Observation``, ``So,``, ``Based on``).
2. Strip a leading ``Final Answer:`` prefix.
3. Take only the first non-empty line (benchmark answers are short).
4. Map unanswerable / not-found responses to the empty string so they
   score correctly against empty ground truth on LoCoMo adversarial
   questions.

The regex and rule set are intentionally conservative: they fire on
obvious leakage but do not rewrite answer content.
